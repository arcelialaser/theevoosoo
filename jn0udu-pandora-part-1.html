As the title says, the release of part 2 is delayed for another week. Something came up (day job related) so we are going to be shorthanded this and next week.

Hey guys, this is the prologue of a new series I’m writing. It’s based on a Stellaris playthrough which I am currently playing and rping. I have been recording my actions and built a story around the events that transpired during the course of the game. These events are the prologue that will eventually lead to the start of the game so there isn’t much hyf just yet, but more will come soon. These are the events leading up to… ampnbsp; The Chronicles of Pandora. ampnbsp; Spetember In this tutorial, we're looking at Pandora's beautiful animations when a user taps a radio station and it expands into the full-screen. You fight Raijin and Fujin in the first round of this dungeon for 21 stamina a try. Fairly easy fight if you've been playing a while. Just did it for first time and got a major wind orb. I don't know what else drops, but it might be worth farming! Edit: perhaps I'm lucky but I've done 10 times now and got 4 major winds.

WP A little child finds a box on the street and opens it. In it is a computerchip named 'Pandora' --- Part 1 Part 2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/badbendude/comments/6r2rbu/pandora_part_2/) --- As the child wandered through the deserted streets of Birmingham, a chill seemed to rise in the air and forced her to pull the overcoat tightly across her body. It was much too long for her; it belonged to her father, and the coattails dragged weightily along the ash-covered ground. After Abby's homeland security think tank is compromised and she is found in possession of a real bomb, the NCIS team discovers the leader of the group has been murdered and a theoretical terror playbook has been stolen.

I’m sorry. I’m a professional human. I studied law at university and was working for a law firm as a paralegal at the time. I, mostly, take myself pretty serious. I’m not one to do things that are out of the ordinary and try to be a responsible human being. But. It was my honeymoon. And lots of alcohol was involved. Me and my wife got married in the UK and decided to fly over to Florida for 2 weeks. something we had been so excited for- perhaps more than the wedding itself. Just because.

Florida Disney in February … it is supposed to be slower in February but we had a couple really crazy days with wait lines over a hundred minutes for the major rides.

Since the age of about 12 I can remember myself being a pretty depressed kid. Often I would sit at home and 'console' myself with video games for hours on end. Console, console, get it?

Pandora’s grip tightened around Lorelai hands. Her grip was tight, much much tighter than Lorelai thought it should be possible. The girl looked so small, it was easy to forget at any given moment that she wasn’t actually dealing with a child. This was not a little girl full of wonder and hope. Lorelai swore that she could hear her fingers begin to creak as Pandora tightened even more. The girl was not a child, she was something stronger and darker and more foreign.

A month back I decided to drive the 12 hours back to NYC to visit my family. What better way to enjoy the drive than with satellite radio. The pricing for the radios were  plus. Quite expensive for my taste. Most radios come with 3 months free. So the radio would cost  divided by 3, is /month. Pretty much their full asking price. Luckily my neighbor just bought a used car with an Onyx EZ, mine for free if I could remove the radio. I got a  prepaid XM gift card and got 5 month I hope you’re still following MortzeArt! .
