When using VLC, I've had no advertisements at all, with no use for adblocks like uBlock Origin. _Now_ it seems that the only way to circumvent advertisements in Twitch is to have a start delay. As stated in the previous thread, I've had no advertisements for years using the VLC method of watching streams. Today was a comple. Hello all! I'm using VLC as my main video play since ages ago. Did anyone encounter this problem? 1. You play a video 2. You close VLC by closing the window or by ALT-F4 (at this point the VLC icon is still visible in the XFCE panel) 3. You try to play another video file and VLC does not play the media Is this a DE bug, a VLC bug? Am I doing something wrong? Where can I report this? Greatly appreciated. Yay! My partner and I got accepted into the apartments in town. Last time we lived outside of one of our families' houses- my MIL requested to be texted. Every. Single. Day. And just by my SO. SHE could not start this conversation. If she didn't, she would guilt trip and (I think) genuinely get disappointed with her son! She would text me passive aggressively- "How was SO's day? I haven't heard from him. Is he ok?" Never asked how I was and at the time, it hurt. Now I don't want her to engage. I usually post on JustNoFamily and JustNoMIL so here is some background: My in laws have all decided that I'm bipolar and abusive towards my children b/c I started showing my anger and exasperation at the family dynamics and have rules for my kids. I am not mentally ill nor am I abusive. People who know me and my family well can confirm. We have been VVVLC since last August. In laws have stated I'm no longer allowed in same room (even a restaurant) as niece and nephew. Over two years ago, after 28 years of extremely toxic and abusive relationship with my JNM, I started growing a spine. This created a domino effect of my siblings also showing shiny spines. Sibling 1 and I are both newly VLC with my JNM since January except for one instance of attending the funeral of JNM's brother. Sibling 2 agreed to let JNM and their husband visit for Mother's Day Friday - Monday, despite Sibling 2 is moving in a few days later and JNM's trip is selfish timing. 
Hello all, I have posted here before, although it turned out to be a more JustNoSO's problem. amp#x200B; Background: FMIL, FFIL, my JYmom and me all work at the same part time job together. It's how FDH and I met (he used to work there). We all work in the same department too. Mostly I work with FFIL and FMIL, not my JYmom amp#x200B; Today's issue is that over the past few weeks, i've been JNFMIL and JNFFIL noticing taking slight digs at me whenever my shift is over, saying stuff Hi all, amp#x200B; I changed from the inbuilt Kodi player to VLC on my shield as i was having to constantly adjust the audio sync settings for TV shows and Movies. It became quite annoying after a while. Don't have the problem with any other app except for Kodi. amp#x200B; After doing so Seren no longer looks for streams for the next episode of the TV show i am watching. Is there a way to tell Seren to start looking for the next episode once i have clicked a stream when using </p>
