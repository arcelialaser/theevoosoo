                            <p>Do you guys have a trick to use Hearthpwn's website on your mobile device? Last measurements from this morning on a Honor x6 with 24Gb flash free and browser cache cleared: main page loading time is 29.3 seconds on Firefox! Media is displayed at 14+s but scripts execute until 30 seconds. When using Privacy browser, it's 13.78s. This is without being logged in, when logged in with my hearthpwn account it's 48s on the main page with Firefox! I have to tap screen twice orherwise my mobile screen. I usually use my laptop to stream the games but as tonight I’m stuck on a train with only my iphone 8. The streams never seem to play correctly or at all on my phone. Any ideas. Naked Browser or Puffin Browser? Or do you guys have an alternative browser which Is there any way to get Adblock to work in puffing because I still get video I have a Gamecenter subscription but they still haven't updated their app so I can't access preseason games. Really want to be able to catch the Sens/Leafs game tonight!.

I've seen a few users (Paging u/FuzzyPuffin) complain about the Kindle version not being available over the past few weeks, and many have said that the pdf version is the sidebar wasn't ideal for them to use (Kindle sucks at reading pdfs as well as ePubs or their own format.) I'd had the same gripe and tracked down a free ePub version on a site with the worst anti-adblock (http://atabencot.net/rweasy/-64808ERJZ/3263596/banner/http://lastnewb1e.blogspot.com/2015/06/metro-2033-english-e-book-e.

I am wondering if there is an app browser that already has build in vpn inside such as puffin browser, but the problem is puffin does not include adblock inside it unlike kiwi browser (problem with kiwi is that there is no build in vpn inside it). I want to look for an app that is a combination Hey guys, Here are some rules regarding streams and what they would need to be qualified: 1. Link directly to the stream.

Lots of people are saying Vivaldi is the best for Perk, but after the recent Opera and Puffin ban for EH I'm concerned about using it. Is Vivaldi ban-safe for EH? Does it use a compression or adblock server? How does it run for you? Thanks. Edit: Issue was solved. One way is to use the Incognito window. The other way is I whitelisted the program in the "Privacy Badger", "Disconnect" and AdBlock Plus extensions. I'm not sure exactly which one was causing the issue. The site is working on both my PC Chrome browser and the Chromebook Chrome browser. ---------------------------------------- For the past few days, I have issues accessing the website using Chrome and on my Chromebook. Both have the most up to date version of Chrom. 
Like the last stream, this one is airing at 7:00 AM JST ( time conversion here ( If you're going to use the Evitoostore link to the right to stream TV Asahi, there are two things to know: 1. Use Adblock. It makes your life easier. 2. It does not work on mobile. Vaughn works on mobile with the Puffin Browser. You can get it on iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puffin-. I am trying to help my mom watch streaming flash on her ipad. On my windows PC, I go to sites like watchcartoononline.com and don't have any problems, because of my adblock plus. Anyway, I just tried to go there and watch a video on the Puffin browser for ipad, and the ads made it unusable. So, I need a solution for both flash and ads. Any suggestions? Update I was able to stream the videos I want without flash, and I downloaded iCab Mobile and Atomic browsers is there anyway to force adblock or minimal host blocker to work on puffin? i only use that browser because i can download stuff easily to my ifile unlike safari. </p>
