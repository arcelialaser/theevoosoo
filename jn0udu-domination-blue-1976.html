                            <p>Hello! I know most of you have still not recovered from the lack of Sweet Victory in the Super Bowl. Yeah, it sucks. That's why I'm presenting you, once again, the one spectacle it's always guaranteed to be amazing, and that's the samba schools parade. Today, I'll present six more options of Rio de Janeiro samba schools for you, mostly centered about the ones that were sucessful arounf the 70's and 80's. Are you ready? Let's go! ## BEIJA-FLOR Foundation : 1948 Hails from : Nilóp. Alternate history or alternative history is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently. These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record.

And so we have reached the final match up of the 1970's Frightfest!!! My sincere thanks to all who have participated, I encourage you to complete a bracket and submit to kickbrickley@yahoo.com by 11/3, as the winner will be crowned during our wrapup party on November 4th. To the films: Peter Cushing closes out his domination of the bracket with a little help from some Kung Fu warriors and Chinese Dracula in an ass-kicking, genre-bending adventure that delivers the goods. In the other corner (#f/northcarolina) North Carolina (#f/acc) Atlantic Coast Conference , (#f/socon)Southern Conference from 1921-1953 Basic Info Official Name - North Carolina is the oldest public university in the United States, UNC-CH was founded in 1789 and graduated it's first class in 1798. North Carolina is the only public university to have issued degrees in the 18th century. We were also known as North Carolina University (1789–1963), hence why NCU is in our Alma Mater.

The Guns of Gettysburg - 2013 ( (8.8). Helena arrives with her curly chestnut colored hair tied back into a ponytail, with a pair of John Lennon sunglasses perched on a pert nose. She isn't what you would call a conventional beauty; she's a little too thin and she has this distracting birthmark over her right eyebrow, but there's something about her that commands a presence. She speaks intelligently and she always seems to be curious about the world around her. I get lost in listening to her voice because it's easy to listen </p>
